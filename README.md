**WHAT IS CHEMBALANCE? <br/>**
ChemBalance is a software that allows you to balance chemical reactions of any kind. <br/>


**HOW DO I USE CHEMBALANCE? <br/>**
You can execute it by terminal using the following format: python .\balancer.py CHEM1 CHEM2 = CHEM3 CHEM4.
Make sure that the chemicals are written correctly (CO2, Br2O3) using uppercase and lowercase as normal, as the
algoritm uses those to detect different chemicals. The output will be given in terminal and on a .txt file named
'balance.txt'. <br/>
